      "I started my first diet when I was eight years old. It began with skipping breakfast, eliminating certain foods and, evolved to not eating for extended periods of the day. I believed that the less I ate, the more weight I could lose and the more valued I was. By my teens, thoughts about food and diets had infiltrated my mind, body, and spirit. There was never an hour in the day when I didnâ€™t think about what I ate, what I was going to eat, what I looked like, and how I compared to others. From thigh gaps, hip dips, and arm jiggles to flat stomachs, each body part became my obsession. I experienced this in the early 2000s but it is still very relevant. A 2023 systematic review showed that 22% of children and adolescents across the globe reported disordered eating with a significantly higher proportion (30%) among girls.";
